# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "Comprehensive testing of the updated Tenders Dashboard API confirms that the new statuses work correctly. Successfully tested creating tenders with 'Offer' and 'Contract Signed' statuses, verified that 'Offer' is the default status when none is provided, confirmed filtering works with the new statuses, and validated that update operations can change status to the new values. All tests passed successfully."

    message: "Identified critical issue with the frontend: The dashboard is not loading due to a React hooks error in the GanttChart component. The error message is 'Rendered more hooks than during the previous render'. The specific issue is in the GanttChart component where there's an early return statement `if (!offers.length) return null;` before some hook calls. This violates React's Rules of Hooks, as hooks must be called in the same order on every render. The fix would be to move all hook declarations to the top of the component, before any conditional returns. The backend API is working correctly, but the frontend needs to be fixed to ensure hooks are called in the same order on every render."

    message: "Successfully fixed the React hooks error in the GanttChart component by moving the useEffect hook before the conditional return statement. Completed comprehensive testing of all frontend components: 1) GANTT chart is now working correctly with proper horizontal scrolling, fixed left column, and 'Go to Today' functionality, 2) Dark theme is implemented consistently across the entire dashboard, 3) Dashboard layout follows the correct order with charts positioned below the table, 4) All charts (Funnel, Pie, Bar) are rendering correctly with proper styling and tooltips, 5) Filtering controls work as expected and update all visualizations in real-time, 6) PDF export functionality is available and properly implemented. All components are now working as expected with no console errors or UI issues."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the updated Tenders Dashboard backend API. All endpoints have been successfully renamed from 'offers' to 'tenders' and the new due_date field is properly implemented. The API health check, CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), filtering functionality, and filter helper endpoints are all working correctly. The backend properly handles data validation, UUID generation, date serialization/deserialization (including the new due_date field), and MongoDB integration. All tests passed successfully with no issues found."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the updated Tenders Dashboard backend API with the new statuses. All tests passed successfully. The API now correctly accepts and validates the new 'Offer' and 'Contract Signed' statuses. Creating tenders with these statuses works properly, and the default status for new tenders is correctly set to 'Offer' when no status is provided. Filtering by the new statuses works as expected, and updating tenders to use these statuses is also functioning correctly. The backend API is fully compatible with the new status requirements."
